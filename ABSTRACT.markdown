# Abstract

This project analyzes open-access EEG data from PhysioNet to investigate brain wave patterns and subject activeness across various experimental conditions. The dataset was preprocessed using Python, applying Butterworth and notch filters to remove artifacts and noise, ensuring high-quality signals. In the time domain, Root Mean Square (RMS) values were calculated to assess signal amplitude variations across experiments, revealing a significant reduction in noise with filtering, though some subjects exhibited high RMS peaks (e.g., ~800 for s20 in 3MRSEO). In the frequency domain, Power Spectral Density (PSD) was estimated using the Welch method for alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves, enabling analysis of spectral power across experiments. The filters minimally affected frequency-domain PSD, likely due to the Welch method's robustness. An activeness index, defined as the beta/alpha PSD ratio, was computed, ranging from 0.07 to 2.4, with peaks at 2.3â€“2.4 for subjects s09 (3MMEH) and s18 (3MRSEO), indicating high cognitive arousal. The analysis highlights distinct RMS and PSD patterns, with filters enhancing time-domain clarity. The Python-based codebase and visualizations are publicly available, enabling replication or adaptation for other EEG datasets. This project contributes to neuroscience and brain-computer interface development through a reproducible EEG analysis framework.
